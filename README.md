### This is the main repo for my hosted portfolio 

This code creates a 3D character controller that can be moved around using the keyboard.

The controller uses a finite state machine to determine its current state. The states include idle, walk, run, and dance. The controller can be switched between states by pressing the appropriate keys.

The controller also has a built-in animation system that allows it to play different animations depending on its state. For example, the controller will play a walk animation when it is in the walk state.

The code uses the three.js library to create the 3D scene and the character controller. The three.js library is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.

## To:do
Making it compatable with mobile
Adding more of the projects I've done
implimenting a raycaster for users to click on the 3d objects to redirect
